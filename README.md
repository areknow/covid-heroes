# COVIDHEROES.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/01d72635-9090-4329-bf95-33fd5083add8/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/covidheroes/deploys)

This webapp is built to help serve the medical community that is in need of PPE and other supplies. Users can contact the volunteer network in order to donate equipment, and medical providers can request equipment. There is also an option to join the volunteer effort.

The site is built with React and hosted on Netlify and also leverages Netlify Functions and SparkPost for email routing.

Painless development made possible by using my [Alpha Components](https://github.com/areknow/alpha-components) library.
